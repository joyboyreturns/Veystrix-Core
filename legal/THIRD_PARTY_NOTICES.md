# Third-party notices

Veystrix is proprietary freeware (see LICENSE). It contains, links to or was derived from the
third-party and earlier open-source works below. Each keeps its own license. Nothing in the
Veystrix license reduces your rights under them.

_Generated 2026-11-10. Full license texts of the Python packages ship in the app bundle under_
_`Contents/Resources/Licenses/`._

## 1. Earlier MIT-licensed work

Large parts of the Veystrix engine descend from code published under the MIT license in
earlier releases of this project (including the FlashNext runtime). That code was published and remains available
under the MIT license; the license of copies already distributed is not withdrawn. The copyright
holder is named in that license. The license text, which must accompany the code, is:

```

Some modules also reproduce or adapt MIT-licensed code from MLX and MLX-LM (Apple Inc. and
contributors), for example the compiled gate chain in `models/flashnext/compiled.py`, which
follows the structure of the upstream `Qwen4ExpPLELayer`.

## 4. Model checkpoints are not included

Veystrix does not include or redistribute model weights. Each checkpoint (for example Qwen3.8
Flash-Next variants, K2-Horizon, Ternary-Bonsai-2, Qwen3.8-27B) is distributed by its publisher
under that publisher's license. Read it before you download, use, modify or redistribute the checkpoint.
